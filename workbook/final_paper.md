# Final Paper Requirements

*20 points*

Students may choose to turn in an essay instead of completing a web application.  Each student writing a paper must work independently.

**Due Date: Wednesday, June 7, 11:59pm**

Late work will not be accepted.

### Prompt

Choose one of the following titles for your paper:

1. Unexpected Truths in Software Project Management
2. Paradoxes of Software Project Management
3. What Every Non-Technical Manager Should Know About Technology

### Expectations

* I'm not interested in reading about current industry philosophy as much as I care about what _you_ have personally learned this quarter.  In other words, I do not want your paper to read like an impersonal Wikipedia article.

* Real-world stories of how you intend to apply what you've learned, or have already seen others apply, is more important than abstract theory.

* Length doens't matter to me, but I'd be surprised if you think you can adequately write something insightful in less than three pages.  I'm guessing 3-5 pages should do it.  10 pages is probably a bit much but if you're that excited about the topic, go for it!



### How To Turn In Your Project

Do NOT email your final paper to me.  You have two options:

* Share a Google Doc with me: `cohen.jeff@gmail.com` (do not use my NU address)

* Use a _private_ workspace named *final* in your C9 account (you should already have this workspace from your milestone).  Upload your paper into top-level folder of your workspace using the _File > Upload local files_ option.  Share it with `jeffcohen`.

Please send a Canvas message to me when your paper is ready for review.
