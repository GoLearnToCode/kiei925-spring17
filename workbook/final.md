# Final Project Requirements

Every student is required to turn in a Ruby on Rails web application. You're highly encouraged to work in groups, but each student must turn in their own project.

**Due Date: Wednesday, March 15, 11:59pm**

Late work will not be accepted.

### How To Turn In Your Project

Your final project must be contained in a workspace named *final* or *project* in your C9 account. You can specify the `starting-point` repository as the initial clone url, or you can start with a blank Rails application and edit the Gemfile yourself.

Please send an email to Garrett when your project is ready for review; include the name of your final project workspace and your live URL (if applicable).

### Web App Grading Criteria

Projects can achieve a maximum of 25 points.

1. Each requirement listed below is worth up to 7 points. You may choose up to 3 requirements, for a total of 21 possible points.
2. Up to 4 points will be awarded based on the instructor's subjective evaluation of your  code readability, usability, visual styling, and originality.

### Requirements Menu

Pick any 3.  Each item is worth up to 7 points.

- Write a 2-page paper related to startup programming and management.  Examples: agile vs traditonal project management; how this course has affected your understanding of building apps;  technology risks/pitfalls in early stage startups; etc.
- Provide wireframes, user stories, and business rules for your entire application.
- Authentication and authorization: Allow users to sign up, sign in, and sign out. Protect sensitive parts of your application through the use of a before_action. Implement role-based authorization and support at least two different types of users to access different parts of your application.
- Create a custom `rake` task to populate your database via CSV file, or load data from an external web service, etc. Note: Using the APIs we've used in class (Forecast.io, Spotify, OMDB) does not qualify unless it is materially enhances your project.
- Deploy your app to Heroku.com. (If working in a group, only one live deployment is required.) Include your live URL in your submission (i.e. your email to Garrett) for full credit.
