# Final Project Requirements

Every student is required to turn in a Ruby on Rails web application. You're highly encouraged to work in groups, but each student must turn in their own project.

**Due Date: Wednesday, June 7, 11:59pm**

Late work will not be accepted.

### Requirements

* Build a small MVP of a concept product or service.
* Your app should demonstrate:
  * content for visitors
  * user signup
  * user-specific functionality



### How To Turn In Your Project

Your final project must be contained in a _private_ workspace named *final* in your C9 account. You should use the `starting-point` repository as the initial clone url.

Please send a Canvas message to Garrett when your project is ready for review; include the name of your final project workspace and your live URL (if applicable).

### Web App Grading Criteria

Projects can achieve a maximum of 25 points.

Each of the following are worth 5 points:

1. Domain model milestone (week 6)
2. A set of user stories (usually 10 - 20 stories)
3. An app that demonstrates a potential MVP of a real or imaginary business.  "Uber for Cats" is totally acceptable.
4. User authentication and authorization
  * Allow users to sign up, sign in, and sign out.
  * Protect sensitive parts of your application
  * Use securely-encrypted passwords
5. Instructor's subjective evaluation of your  code readability, usability, visual styling, and originality.




### Milestone: DUE: Week 6 (May 5)

- Entire domain model (at least three models)
