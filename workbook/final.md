# Final Project Requirements

Every student is required to turn in a Ruby on Rails web application. You're highly encouraged to work in groups, but each student must turn in their own project.

**Due Date: Wednesday, June 7, 11:59pm**

Late work will not be accepted.

### Requirements

* Build a small MVP of a concept product or service.
* Your app should demonstrate:
  * content for visitors
  * user signup
  * user-specific functionality



### How To Turn In Your Project

Your final project must be contained in a _private_ workspace named *final* in your C9 account. You should use the `starting-point` repository as the initial clone url.

Please send a Canvas message to Garrett when your project is ready for review; include the name of your final project workspace and your live URL (if applicable).

### Web App Grading Criteria

Projects can achieve a maximum of 25 points.

1. Each requirement listed below is worth up to 7 points.
2. Up to 4 points will be awarded based on the instructor's subjective evaluation of your  code readability, usability, visual styling, and originality.

### Specific Requirements
