**Goals:**

- Reading and hacking prewritten code
- Mastery of `find_by`, `where`, `order`, `count`, `pluck`
- collection_select
- derivation of has_many, belongs_to
- maybe `to_sentence` for the cast

**Prep:**

- ./catchup

Lecture:
  - how about those estimates?
  - Name one thing you like or hate about Getting Real
  - Questions about user stories?

Icebreaker Challenge:
  - Identify one thing you're curous about and figure it out


Demo Challenge: console
  - how many movies were released before 2000?
  - ...what are the titles of those movies?
  - ...in alphabetical order?
  - how many movies are less than 2 hours long?
  - which movie has something to do with astronauts?

Review every `index` page
Review every `show` page
Review `movies/new`


**BREAK**

Slides on one screen, write queries on the other chalkboard

Rewrite counts on index pages using `has_many`
Rewrite show pages using `has_many` and `belongs_to`

FUN: Maybe `pluck` and then `to_sentence` and then `pluralize`
