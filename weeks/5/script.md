**Goals:**

- Reading and hacking prewritten code
- Mastery of `find_by`, `where`, `order`, `count`, `pluck`
- collection_select
- derivation of has_many, belongs_to
- maybe `to_sentence` for the cast

**Prep:**

- ./catchup

Lecture:
  - how about those estimates?
  - Name one thing you like or hate about Getting Real
  - Project Spreadsheet
  - Use the Workbook!!

Icebreaker Challenge:
  - Identify one thing you're curous about and figure it out

Review every `index` page
Review every `show` page
Review `movies/new`


**BREAK**

Slides on one screen, write queries on the other chalkboard

Rewrite counts on index pages using `has_many`
Rewrite show pages using `has_many` and `belongs_to`

Maybe `pluck` and then `to_sentence`
