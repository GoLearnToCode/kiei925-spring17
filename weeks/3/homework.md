Before you start: you were supposed to have done these readings back in week 1.  If you didn't, read them now:

* [Introduction to User Stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)
* [Advantages of the User Story Template](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/advantages-of-the-as-a-user-i-want-user-story-template)


1. Create a new Google Sheet.
  - Name it `hw3`.  
  - Name the sheet tab (at the bottom) "User Stories"
2. Share it with Garrett's email: `garrett@sturdy.work`.
3. Go to Etsy.com and browse around a bit.  Now, imagine the MVP if you were building it from scratch.  Recall the Amazon.com MVP screenshot we discussed in class.  I don't have an early Etsy.com screenshot so you'll have to use your imagination.
5. Brainstorm as many user stories as you can that you think would comprise the *minimum viable product* and enter them.  Use whatever format you think is best, but make sure you follow the general template for good user stories.

Have fun!
