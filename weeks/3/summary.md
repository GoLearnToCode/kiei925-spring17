* How are those estimates?

**Here's the plan for today**.

* Learn how to create a *domain model* using the `models.yml` file
* Perform model queries with `.all`, `.where`, and `.find_by`
* Sort your data with `.order`
* Model one-to-many associations by using _foreign keys_
* Learn to use `if` statements to add decision-making powers to our app.


*If all goes well, by the end of class today, you should be able to:*

* Create database-backed models
* Use the `rake db:migrate` to change your database
* Use the `rake db:seed` to reset and/or populate your database
* Use the `rails console` to "CRUD" your data
