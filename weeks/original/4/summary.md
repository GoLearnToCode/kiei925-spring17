# Goals

* Understand the different ways to send data between pages in your web app
* Learn how to CRUD in the browser
* Understand how web applications are a collection of resources, not web pages
* Learn how to implement resource-based routing (aka REST) in practice


[Bootstrap forms documentation](https://github.com/bootstrap-ruby/rails-bootstrap-forms)

* We can use Ruby code to add intelligence to our views.  A typical `if` statement looks like this:

``` ruby
# Notice the double equal sign!
<%% if password == "swordfish" %>
  <p>You said the magic word!</p>
<%% end %>

# Notice the strange != sign!
<%% if password != "swordfish" %>
  <p>Nah-ah-ah! You didn't say the magic word!</p>
<%% end %>
