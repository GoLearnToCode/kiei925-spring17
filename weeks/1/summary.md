**Here's the plan for today.**

* What in the world are we doing here?
* What is an MVP? (No, I don't mean Patrick Kane or Kris Bryant)
* Become familiar with the value of low-fidelity wireframes
* Get familiar with Cloud9
* Create your first web page in Ruby on Rails

If all goes well, by the end of class today, you should be able to:

* Use the Cloud9 editor to write code and start the Rails server
* Make your own HTML pages inside of a Rails application
* Realize that everything Jeff says in class is a movie reference or a lame joke
