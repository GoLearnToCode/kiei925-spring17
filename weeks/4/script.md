**Goals:**

- if statements
- web CRUD
- redirect_to
- nested hash params

**Prep:**

- ./catchup

Lecture:
  - how about those estimates?
  - What do you think of Getting Real so far?
  - Project Spreadsheet
  - Use the Workbook!!

Icebreaker Challenge:
  - Directors index is hardcoded - make it data driven


Demo 1: If statement
  - movie show pages work except Cast Away
  - why?
  - if statement in view


Demo 2: New Movie
  - what url do we wish would work?
  - try it!
  - submit - broken - what's wrong?

Challenge: Fix it! Display page showing "Movie added!" if it works

**BREAK**

Demo: Edit page

Challenge: Update action

Demo 4: Delete link goes to `destroy` action

Challenge: Implement `destroy`

Unresolved Pain:
  - how do we edit the director for a movie?
  - how do we add the cast?
